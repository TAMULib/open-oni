## Develop With Us

There is a lot of work to be done on Open ONI. [Joining us on
Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/open-oni/shared_invite/enQtMzg5MDg5NjU5MDU2LTA4MmViOTkxZDliZWZmM2FlMGU5ODZjNDU0OWQxYzIzMTY1YmFlMWEzZDFkNDNjZmYxYzUyMmMwZjlkMjU1MGE)
and [submitting issues](https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni/issues) are both
great ways to get involved without diving into the code.

For those willing to write code, we adhere to our [development
standards](#development-standards) below to keep us all on the same page.

You should start by reviewing the [Docker
install](https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni/tree/dev/docs/install/docker.md)
page to help set up a development environment.

### Workflow

**Important**: All features should be based on the `dev` branch! We use a loose
[gitflow-like](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
branching strategy, and `main` is meant to always be production-ready. Only
*major* bug fixes (such as security issues) should be applied directly to the
`main` branch. Also read the following to inform your git use:
https://drewdevault.com/2019/02/25/Using-git-with-discipline.html

First, fork the [Open ONI repository](https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni) in
GitHub so you have rights to push code. Then clone it, check out `dev`, create a
feature branch, and do your work:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your github namespace>/open-oni.git
cd open-oni
git checkout dev
git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-oni-thing
```

When you're ready, push up your code and
[submit a pull request](https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni/pulls).
**Make sure** the pull request is against the `dev` branch, *not* `main`.

### Testing

```bash
docker-compose -f test-compose.yml -p onitest up test
```

This will produce a lot of output and you'll have to scroll back to get read
test failure information, but it runs a test container setup that ensures your
development data will not be modified.

## Development Standards

Below are our coding standards and best practices for Open ONI development.

Language Notes:

- "Use" is a positive instruction, equivalent to "must use".
- "Prefer" indicates a better option and its alternative to watch out for.
- "Avoid" means don't do it unless you have good reason.
- "Don't" means there's never a good reason.

### Style Guidelines

1. In existing files, prefer to stay consistent with code style used by the
   older code
1. In new code, use [Django coding
   standards](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/internals/contributing/writing-code/coding-style/)
1. Don't mix style fixes with other changes
1. Don't rewrite entire files to fix style without communicating to the team
   (this can result in VERY painful merging)
1. Use unix-style line endings
1. Use a newline at the end of the file
1. Don't leave trailing whitespace

#### Documentation

1. Try to document every method using block comments
    - Prefer docstring-style comments for easier automatic documentation
1. Avoid inline comments

### Source Control

1. Use Git and GitHub for source control
1. Use commit messages that follow the conventions here whenever possible:
   http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html
1. Use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) for tags

#### Feature Branches

1. Do work in feature branches, named with a prefix `feature/[branch-name]`
1. Publish feature branches to the GitHub repository when:
    - Collaboratively developing the feature
    - Seeking code review in advance of a pull request
    - Sharing the feature externally
    - If your code isn't going to be useful or meaningful to others, clean it up
      first
1. Send pull requests to merge features to `dev`
1. Delete branches when they are fully merged and no longer needed
1. Developers will collaborate to merge additions to `dev` into `main` for
   releases

#### Pull Requests and Merging

1. Keep pull requests clean:
    - Retain "milestone" commits, representing substantial peices of work
    - Squash minor and personal workflow commits into milestones
1. Pull requests are subject to review. Someone other than you must merge them

### Security

1. Prefer environment variables for storing confidential information (database
   passwords, session secrets, etc)
1. When configuration files are required:
    - Do provide an example config
    - Use .gitignore to ensure the true config is not in source control
    - Prefer production config setup via automatic deploys, not manually copying
      files

### Release Checklist

Follow these steps for each Open ONI release:

- Ensure `core/version.py` is set to the new version on the release PR
- Review and merge the release PR into `main`
- [Create a GitHub release](https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni/releases/new)
- Update [open-oni.github.io
  source](https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni.github.io) as necessary
- Merge the `main` branch back into the `dev` branch
- Copy the template for unreleased work in `CHANGELOG.md` and add a template
  changelog entry file at `changelogs/YYYY-MM-DD-branch_name.md` on `dev`
- Post an announcement to #general channel on Slack and the [Chronam Users
  mailing list](https://listserv.loc.gov/cgi-bin/wa?A0=CHRONAM-USERS)
